                        Welcome to a special SoPra edition of the famous board game Scotland Yard!<br/>
                        This time, Mister X tries to escape the detectives in the city of Zurich.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <h4>Starting Position</h4>
                        This game is designed for <b>3-6 players</b>. One person becomes Mister X and all the others are Detectives.
                        The roles and initial positions on the map are assigned automatically.<br/>
                        <br/>

                        Mister X is not visible to the detectives most of the time.<br/>
                        His/her position is revealed at <b>rounds 3, 8, 13, 18 and 22 </b> (highlighted on the blackboard). <br/> 
                        Outside of these rounds, the detectives can see the last revealed position of Mr X. For example, if it's currently round 5, the detectives see where Mr X was at round 3.
                        Mr X always sees his/her current position.<br/>
                        <br/>

                        </Row>
                        After every round, Mr X reveals the ticket he/she has used. This information is shown on the blackboard. <br/>
                        You can also see when the position of Mr X was last revealed and which rounds it will be visible again.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        <h4>Game Flow</h4>
                        Up to 22 rounds are played. In one round, Mister X first makes his move and then each of 
                        the detectives make their moves. <br/>
